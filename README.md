## What is this?

This is a jamstack:
- frontend: SvelteKit + Tailwind + PostCSS + Vite,
- backend: Supabase.

Those tools were used to create a simple TODO app. The app consists of components, validation, CRUD operations, hashed passwords, and all the necessary things required to pass the assessment.
